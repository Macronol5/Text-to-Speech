# Text-to-Speech
In this code you can make a text into voice.

Inside your command prompt or your ide’s terminal type:

pip install pyttsx3

You may face this error

no module named 'pythoncom'

To resolve this you need to type

pip install pywin32

in your command prompt or ide’s terminal

If your error is one or more from the errors given below then your problem will be solved after installing pywin32


Now let’s have a look at the source code with explanation

# import the pyttsx module inside program
import pyttsx3

# initializing the module
engine = pyttsx3.init()

# .say() function is used to speak the text you have written 
# inside the function
engine.say("Anything you write here will be spoken by your computer during the running of the program")

# this is used to process and run the program commands
engine.runAndWait()
